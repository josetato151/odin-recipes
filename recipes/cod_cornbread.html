        <ul>
            <li>1 onion <em style="color:#808080;">(large, sliced into thin half-moons)</em></li>
            <li>5 cloves of garlic <em style="color:#808080;">(thinly sliced)</em></li>
            <li>½ cup of olive oil <em style="color:#808080;">(or more, as needed)</em></li>
            <li>4 salted cod loins <em style="color:#808080;">(Already pre-soaked to remove excess salt and ready to cook, about 850g to 1kg [1.8 to 2.2 lbs])</em></li>
            <li>400 g cornbread <em style="color:#808080;">(Portuguese style yellow cornbread, 1-2 days old, crusts removed and torn into smaller pieces)</em></li>
            <li>¼ cup parsley <em style="color:#808080;">(fresh, chopped)</em></li>
            <li>salt and pepper <em style="color:#808080;">(to taste)</em></li>
            <li>1 Kg potatoes <em style="color:#808080;">(small size, skin on, washed, about 2 lb)</em></li>
            <li>1 head broccoli <em style="color:#808080;">(large, stem removed, cut into florets)</em></li>
            <li>½ head cabbage <em style="color:#808080;">([optional] white, large stem removed, cult into bite-sized pieces)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 390°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a pot with cold water seasoned with salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Bring to a boil and cook until soft.</li>
            <li>Remove the cooked potatoes with a slotted spoon or spider and use the same boiling water (add more water if necessary and adjust the salt) to cook the cabbage (optional) for 5 minutes or until done to your taste. At the same time, you can steam the broccoli florets by placing a basket or sieve over the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Reserve the cooked vegetables.</li>
            <li>On a large baking dish, distribute the sliced onion, the garlic, and drizzle generously with olive oil. Arrange the cod loins on top of this bed of onions, drizzle each one with a little more olive oil, and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the cod is roasting, add the cornbread pieces, salt and pepper to taste, and the chopped parsley to the food processor. Pulse a few times adding olive oil until it has the consistency of wet coarse sand.</li>
            <li>Remove cod from the oven (after the 15 minutes are up). Divide the cornbread mixture into four portions and cover each loin with a portion, pressing gently (without breaking the loin) to form a crust.</li>
            <li>If desired, add the boiled potatoes to the same tray as the cod. If there is leftover cornbread mixture, sprinkle around the loins on the baking dish. Return everything to the oven. Bake for another 15 minutes or until the bread crumbs are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Serve each cod loin with cornbread crust accompanied by the cooked vegetables drizzled with the hot olive oil sauce and onions on the tray.</li>
        </ol>
